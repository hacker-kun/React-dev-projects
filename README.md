#USERADD - 

IT's an application that is focused on adding error overlays using react portals. This is a practice project that uses two basic hooks that i leanred during my react development.

 <b>useState and useRef</b>

1. It also uses react portal and fragments to minimise the use of useless div.
2. It uses a no of coustom components.
